                    <p class="lead"><a href="http://www.tomatis.com/en/alfred-tomatis">Dr Alfred Tomatis.</a> 
                        (1920-2001) was a French otolaryngologist and inventor. He received hos Doctorate in Medicine 
                        from Paris School of Medecine. His alternative medicine theories of hearing and listening are
                         known as the Thomatis method or Audio-Psycho-Phonology (APP).

                    <p class="lead">
                            Alfred Tomatis grew up in a musical family in France. His father was an opera singer and he 
                            spent much of his childhood travelling with him and watching his opera performances from the 
                            wings. At an early stage, however, he and his parents decided he was not fit for the stage. 
                            So he went into medicine and eventually became an Ear, Nose and Throat physician. Soon after 
                            he began his practice his father began referring him opera colleagues vith vocal problems. 
                            He formulated the theory that many vocal issues were actually hearing problems. His theoty 
                            that “the voice does not produce what the ear does not hear”, is the landmark of his research 
                            and his method.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        In his attempt to retrain his patients, he developed the Electic Ear, a device which utilizes 
                        electic gating, bone conduction transducers and sound filters to enhance the uppermost missing 
                        frequencies. The goal is to tonify the muscles of rhe middle ear in order to sensitize the listener 
                        to the missing frequencies. Tomatis began treating a number of other problems with the same methods, 
                        including reading problems, dyslexia, depression, severe schizophrenia and even autism. He found 
                        evidence that many of these problems result from a failure of communication, which has to do with 
                        listening and the ear.Tomatis theorized that the whole body is involved in the production of speech 
                        and language. He stated that reading, even silent reading is an activity of the ear. He recommended 
                        reading out loud, not only for children and by children, but also by adults, for 30 minutes a day. 
                        He claimed this not only stimulates the brain but is the best way to learn. His most controversial 
                        method attempts to lead autistic children to recognize and respond to their mother’s voice. 
                        The electric ear could simulate the sound of the mother’s voice heard in the uterus, and to lead the 
                        child gradually to accept and respond to her reql unfiltered voice.
                        
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                            On 1957, he submitted the “Tomatis laws” to the Academy of Sciences in Paris. These laws 
                            established that: The voice only contains what the ear can hear If the listening is modified, 
                            the voice is instantly and unconsciously modified too It is possible to transform the voice 
                            permanently through sound stimulation maintained for some time (law of remanence) In 1958, 
                            the first Electronic Ear was presented at the Universal Exhibition in Brussels, and earned him 
                            the Gold Medal for scientific research.

                <div class="col-sm-12 ">

                    <p class="lead">Learning and communicating are processes that can seem easy as they are natural for
                        most of us. The ability to properly process sensory information is compromised. It is said in
                        this case, that listening is disrupted.
                        In the processing of information, the ear plays a fundamental role since it is the main gateway
                        to our brain. It picks up the surrounding sounds and those of our own voice, converts them into
                        electrical stimuli, and transmits them to the brain which analyzes them. More surprisingly, it
                        also captures our movements and is heavily involved in coordination, balance and rhythm. It
                        therefore has a vital function in daily life, whether through talk, to argue, to follow
                        instructions, read, learn, memorize or simply to move.
                        When communication between the ear and the brain is blurred, our ability to interact with the
                        outside world is compromised. The result is often a loss of self-confidence that will enhance in
                        turn the difficulties of communication and learning.

                        The Tomatis® Method operates through a single handheld device called <a href="https://www.tomatis.com/en/equipment">TalksUp®</a>. 
                        It has been specifically designed to treat music and the voice based on specific parameters.
                        This tool has many features including <a href="https://www.tomatis.com/en/technology">“Electronic Gating®”</a>. 
                        The switch is a unique non-invasive procedure that allows sound contrasts with the sudden transition from low frequency 
                        to high frequencies. This back and forth between low and high frequencies causes a major effort of 
                        adjustment from the ear and creates a stimulation of the brain. After assessing your ability to listen, yourTomatis® 
                        professional establishes a program with sessions tailored to your profile. With TalksUp®, 
                        you can continue your listening program at home or in a certified center. During sessions called "passive", 
                        clients are listening to music with a headset that transmits sound through earphones (air conduction) 
                        but also by bone vibration (bone conduction). During the "active" sessions, clients are reading and 
                        rehearsing exercises through the same headset, equipped with a microphone. 
                        This time it is the voice that is instantly processed to work on the auditory feedback loop.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead">As a physician and researcher, Alfred Tomatis dedicated his life to perfecting his
                        Method in order to effectively help people suffering from communication, attention and learning
                        problems. Alfred Tomatis continuously improved his technique by adding many features to its
                        devices and by gradually altering the measurements of the application protocols. Through
                        patents, trademark licensing contracts and specialized training, he also made sure to protect
                        his technique in order to avoid anything that would compromise its authenticity and efficiency.
                        Through the organization he founded, TOMATIS DEVELOPPEMENT S.A., the company continues, over
                        twenty years, to improve its equipment and to train highly qualified people. The company
                        continues its mission of making the Tomatis® Method accessible and highly effective.</p>
